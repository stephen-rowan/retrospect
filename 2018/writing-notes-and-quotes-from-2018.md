#### Introduction: The Problem of the Sociology of Knowledge

_"It may thus be said that the sociology of knowledge constitutes the sociological focus of a much more general problem, that of the existential determination \(Seinsgebundenheit\) of thought as such_." - \(p. 4\)

"_In all these cases the general problem has been the extent to which thought reflects or is independent of the proposed determinative factors._" -  \(p. 5\). 

_"Although Mannheim did not share Scheler’s ontological ambitions, he too was uncomfortable with the pan-ideologism into which his thinking seemed to lead him. He coined the term “relationism” \(in contradistinction to “relativism”\) to denote the epistemological perspective of his sociology of knowledge—not a capitulation of thought before the socio-historical relativities, but a sober recognition that knowledge must always be knowledge from a certain position._" -  \(p. 10\). 

"_Mannheim believed that different social groups vary greatly in their capacity thus to transcend their own narrow position_." \(p. 10\). 

"_Geiger returned to a narrower concept of ideology as socially distorted thought and maintained the possibility of overcoming ideology by careful adherence to scientific canons of procedure._" \(p. 12\). 

"_The logical structure of this trouble is basically the same in all cases: How can I be sure, say, of my sociological analysis of American middle-class mores in view of the fact that the categories I use for this analysis are conditioned by historically relative forms of thought, that I myself and everything I think is determined by my genes and by my ingrown hostility to my fellowmen, and that, to cap it all, I am myself a member of the American middle class?_" \(p. 13\). 

"_In sum, our enterprise is one of sociological theory, not of the methodology of sociology._" \(p. 13\). 

"_The sociology of knowledge must concern itself with everything that passes for “knowledge” in society._" \(p. 13\). 

"_Theoretical thought, “ideas,” Weltanschauungen are not that important in society. Although every society contains these phenomena, they are only part of the sum of what passes for “knowledge.”_" \(p. 13\). 

"_The theoretical formulations of reality, whether they be scientific or philosophical or even mythological, do not exhaust what is “real” for the members of a society_." \(p. 13\). 

"_These two statements are not contradictory. Society does indeed possess objective facticity. And society is indeed built up by activity that expresses subjective meaning_."  \(p. 17\). 

#### I. The Foundations of Knowledge in Everyday Life 

#### 1. THE REALITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE

"_The method we consider best suited to clarify the foundations of knowledge in everyday life is that of phenomenological analysis, a purely descriptive method and, as such, “empirical” but not “scientific”—as we understand the nature of the empirical sciences._ " \(p. 19\). 

"_The phenomenological analysis of everyday life, or rather of the subjective experience of everyday life, refrains from any causal or genetic hypotheses, as well as from assertions about the ontological status of the phenomena analyzed._" \(p. 19\). 

"_Commonsense contains innumerable pre- and quasi-scientific interpretations about everyday reality, which it takes for granted._" \(p. 19\). 

"_Whether I \(the first person singular, here as in the following illustrations, standing for ordinary self-consciousness in everyday life\) am viewing the panorama of New York City or whether I become conscious of an inner anxiety, the processes of consciousness involved are intentional in both instances._"  \(p. 19\). 

"_The reality of everyday life further presents itself to me as an intersubjective world, a world that I share with others. This intersubjectivity sharply differentiates everyday life from other realities of which I am conscious. I am alone in the world of my dreams, but I know that the world of everyday life is as real to others as it is to myself._" \(p. 22\).

"_I know that my natural attitude to this world corresponds to the natural attitude of others, that they also comprehend the objectifications by which this world is ordered, ..."_ \(p. 22\). 

"_While I am capable of engaging in doubt about its reality, I am obliged to suspend such doubt as I routinely exist in everyday life._" \(p. 22\). 

"_The world of everyday life proclaims itself and, when I want to challenge the proclamation, I must engage in a deliberate, by no means easy effort._" \(pp. 22-24\).

"_As long as the routines of everyday life continue without interruption they are apprehended as unproblematic._" \(p. 24\).
