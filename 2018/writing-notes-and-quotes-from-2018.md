#### Introduction: The Problem of the Sociology of Knowledge

_"It may thus be said that the sociology of knowledge constitutes the sociological focus of a much more general problem, that of the existential determination \(Seinsgebundenheit\) of thought as such_."

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 4\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

"_In all these cases the general problem has been the extent to which thought reflects or is independent of the proposed determinative factors._"

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 5\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

_"Although Mannheim did not share Scheler’s ontological ambitions, he too was uncomfortable with the pan-ideologism into which his thinking seemed to lead him. He coined the term “relationism” \(in contradistinction to “relativism”\) to denote the epistemological perspective of his sociology of knowledge—not a capitulation of thought before the socio-historical relativities, but a sober recognition that knowledge must always be knowledge from a certain position._"

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 10\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

"_Mannheim believed that different social groups vary greatly in their capacity thus to transcend their own narrow position_."

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 10\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

"_Geiger returned to a narrower concept of ideology as socially distorted thought and maintained the possibility of overcoming ideology by careful adherence to scientific canons of procedure._"

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 12\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

"_The logical structure of this trouble is basically the same in all cases: How can I be sure, say, of my sociological analysis of American middle-class mores in view of the fact that the categories I use for this analysis are conditioned by historically relative forms of thought, that I myself and everything I think is determined by my genes and by my ingrown hostility to my fellowmen, and that, to cap it all, I am myself a member of the American middle class?_"

Berger, Peter L.; Luckmann, Thomas. The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge \(p. 13\). Open Road Media. Kindle Edition.

"_In sum, our enterprise is one of sociological theory, not of the methodology of sociology._"
