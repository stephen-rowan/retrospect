### The Society of the Spectacle : Negation and Consumption Within Culture. 

Wordpress:Blogpost:

Here is my initial attempt at reading this section – no doubt with some errors.

Negation and Consumption Within Culture is a fascinating chapter. For me it traces the futility of a radical culture \(in itself\). The reference to The Difference Between the Systems of Fichte and Schelling reminded me of reading Goethe’s correspondence with Schiller recently. Goethe/Schiller struggled to reconcile Kant’s idealism with culture. Schiller went his own way in his Aesthetic letters responding to his disenchantment with the French revolution with his Spieltrieb \(play-drive\) concept. The Spieltrieb would unify the Formtrieb \(the formal drive\) and Sinnestrieb \(the sensuous drive\) as differentiated in Kant’s Idealist system.

Fichte reaches for a similar unity grounded in individuation – Kant’s phenomenal world becomes a projection of self-consciousness. Everything \(noumena\) becomes our representation of it as phenomena. Schelling reverses this tendency in his Naturphilosophie by emphasising the primacy of a fluid, organic nature upon which we project our dogmatism \(teleology\).

The hopes of Schiller and Schelling for a unified culture/reality were to be dashed on the rocks of the 19th century “autonomy of culture” and the rise of criticism. Culture becomes detached \(a project of … self-transcendence\) – another specialism of ‘social critique’. Simultaneously Culture’s presentation is separated “as a dead object for spectacular contemplation” \(184\).

Debord’s reference to Eugenio d’Ors, who ‘chose “life instead of eternity.”’ perhaps reflects a sentiment that art should be “arbitrary,” or subjectivist, breaking with traditional norms. But Debord does not suggest a new unity but rather points to an actual dissolution of art. Spectacular culture as it is presented through its “modernistic pseudoinnovations” seeks to “use culture to bury all historical memory”.

Debords opposition to the structuralist project, the “writing degree zero” of figures such as Roland Barthes appears to be from a post Marxist dialectical position. Barthes critique of socialist realism only serves to further separate criticism from the subject \(204\).

In 206 Debord seems to present détournement in the dialectic tradition \(citing Marx as achieving “the most effective use of this insurrectional style”\). In 208 the superlative presentation of détournement is stated. Détournement as “the opposite of quotation” is a reminder of our “cut and paste” subversion. An echo of ‘by any means necessary’. A recognition of the existing negation of culture.

### Allegory in Plato’s Republic. :Wordpress:Blogpost:

“_I WENT down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess ; and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful._ “

\(Plato, The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by B. Jowett, M.A. in Five Volumes. 3rd edition revised and corrected \(Oxford University Press, 1892\). Chapter: BOOK I\)

In the first few lines of Plato’s Republic Socrates relates his journey to the port town of Piraeus. Piraeus – a natural harbour where the Athenian fleet moored prior to the Peloponnesian War, connected to Athens itself by the Long Walls. Socrates journeys down to Piraeus, kateben, which the scholar Allan Bloom noted as an allusion to Odysseus’ journey into the underworld. The descent of the word katabasis may be contrasted with the ascent of the word anabasis. Anabasis can refer to an expedition from a coastline into the interior of a country while katabasis moves in the opposite direction from the interior to the coast.

So Socrates is descending with Glaucon to the transient and earthy port side. They are moving away from the city state of Athens. A Goddess is being inaugurated, Bendls, the Thracian Artemis in a new festival. “Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals” \(Homer, Iliad xxi 470 f.\). Artemis the huntress – the Greek Diana. The “procession of the \[native\]inhabitants” may be surpassed by that of the novelty of the Thracians.

These lines are an airy allusion to the forthcoming themes of the Republic rather than an explicit analogy. Yet an impression is created of a dialogue rich in allusion and analogy. The descent to Piraeus is allusive but also might be an inductive experience. An experience we might learn from or draw analogies with.

Now consider Glaucon’s initial scepticism of Justice. That the appearance of being just is better than the reality of being just. We have descended to an underworld of Justice – a shadowy port side Justice.

Socrates defense of Justice is also by analogy with the health of tripartite soul of the individual with that of a just city state.

… I found this lecture useful on the symbolism, role-playing and use of analogy in Plato’s Republic.

“Introduction to Political Philosophy \(PLSC 114\)

Lecture 4 introduces Plato’s Republic and its many meanings in the context of moral psychology, justice, the power of poetry and myth, and metaphysics. The Republic is also discussed as a utopia, presenting an extreme vision of a polis–Kallipolis–Plato’s ideal city.”

###  'Reading Marx’s Capital’. 

Wordpress:Blogpost:

I have been watching Prof. David Harvey’s excellent series of lectures on ‘Reading Marx’s Capital’ \(link\). This has reinforced my view that territories of expertise are essentially power relations. Where some kinds of expertise appear neutral \(such as the sciences\) their use or utility is not. The issue of expertise seems to be haunting philosophy at present – with much chatter about the ‘scientific turn’. Typically framed as statements such as “Who needs ethics when everything can be explained by bio-ethics” or “who needs philosophy of mind when neurobiology will provide the answers”. My response may be \(I am still considering this\) to require a dialectic of expertise. What is the expert trying to achieve – is it descriptive or prescriptive etc. It is naive to think such paradigms are neutral.

### Aaron Swartz – 1986-2013. 

Wordpress:Blogpost:

“Fix the machine, not the person.”

Aaron Swartz who co-authored the RSS specification at 14, helped launch Creative Commons at 15 and co-founded Reddit at 18 committed suicide last Friday. Aaron also worked with avaaz.org.

Aaron was being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts with wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer. Aaron had ‘stolen’ JSTOR articles as a protest against JSTOR charging large fees for access to these articles and not compensating academic authors . JSTOR later settled with Aaron in 2011. JSTOR released this statement expressing regret at the further federal prosecution .

He was facing up to 35 years in jail for this crime.

Tributes to Aaron have come from Tim Berners-Lee, Cory Doctorow, Larry Lessig \(professor and founder of Creative Commons\), the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the W3C \(World Wide Web Consortium\).

Here is Aaron in his own words speaking about internet freedom

Academics are posting their papers online as PDFs, in tribute to Aaron Swartz, and providing links on Twitter using the hashtag \#pdftribute

### Can non-Europeans think ?

Wordpress:Blogpost:

Extending the thought that “Words … are much more like values than they are facts,” – we might arrive at a kind of linguistic/ethical relativism. Or, as we seem to do a lot in philosophy, we must pay attention to what we mean by a certain term. So an ethical argument is required to say “I mean this – by saying this” as well as “This thought lead to this”.

A recent article on the Al Jazeera website “Can non-Europeans think?” argues that Kant’s ‘universal law’ is a contrived norm. Hamid Dabashi, a Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University cites Gramsci’s ‘Prison Notebooks’ …

“_Gramsci’s conclusion is that the reason Kant can say what he says and offer his own behaviour as measure of universal ethics is that “Kant’s maxim presupposes a single culture, a single religion, a ‘world-wide’ conformism..._”

I’m not sure if I share Professor Dabashi’s view \(because I am European ?\) – but may he has a point. If he is correct then the words we use to build ethical frameworks can only have a presumed or imposed universality.

### Revising ‘Nights of Labour’: Talk by Jacques Ranciere.

Wordpress:Blogpost:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwW\_LiwCKlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwW_LiwCKlg)

"Video recording of a public talk at Sarai CSDS, by renowned philosopher Jacques Ranciere on the release of the Hindi translation of his book Nights of Labour: Workers' Dream in 19th Century France. \(Sarvahara Raatein: Unneesaveen sadi ke Frans mein Mazdoor Swapna\). The book has been translated from the English by Abhay Kumar Dube. This the first in a series of translations of outstanding texts to be published by Sarai-CSDS and Vani Prakashan.

The talk on the 6th of February 2009 was followed by a workshop and roundtable with Jacques Ranciere, the next day.

Jacques Ranciere is a well known philosopher and writer. As a young student, Ranciere, co-authored Reading Capital \(1968\), with the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser. Ranciere later broke with Althusser over the 1968 uprising in France. Since the 1970s Ranciere has produced a number of remarkable texts that range from working class history, philosophy, education, politics, and aesthetics. His books include The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation\(1991\), The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge \(1994\), The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible Tr. Gabriel Rockhill \(2004\),The Future of the Image \(2007\).

Ranciere wrote The Nights of Labour after years of archival work. It traces the world of worker intellectuals in 19th century France, who, through their poems, music, letters, produced a world that did not celebrate work as in conventional socialist texts, but a life outside it. Radical in its style and argument, Nights of Labour, offers not just a revision of working class history, but the relation between politics, knowledge, aesthetics and equality, all of which have become topics of Ranciere's future books."
