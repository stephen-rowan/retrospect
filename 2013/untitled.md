### The Society of the Spectacle : Negation and Consumption Within Culture. 

Wordpress:Blogpost:

Here is my initial attempt at reading this section – no doubt with some errors.

Negation and Consumption Within Culture is a fascinating chapter. For me it traces the futility of a radical culture \(in itself\). The reference to The Difference Between the Systems of Fichte and Schelling reminded me of reading Goethe’s correspondence with Schiller recently. Goethe/Schiller struggled to reconcile Kant’s idealism with culture. Schiller went his own way in his Aesthetic letters responding to his disenchantment with the French revolution with his Spieltrieb \(play-drive\) concept. The Spieltrieb would unify the Formtrieb \(the formal drive\) and Sinnestrieb \(the sensuous drive\) as differentiated in Kant’s Idealist system.

Fichte reaches for a similar unity grounded in individuation – Kant’s phenomenal world becomes a projection of self-consciousness. Everything \(noumena\) becomes our representation of it as phenomena. Schelling reverses this tendency in his Naturphilosophie by emphasising the primacy of a fluid, organic nature upon which we project our dogmatism \(teleology\).

The hopes of Schiller and Schelling for a unified culture/reality were to be dashed on the rocks of the 19th century “autonomy of culture” and the rise of criticism. Culture becomes detached \(a project of … self-transcendence\) – another specialism of ‘social critique’. Simultaneously Culture’s presentation is separated “as a dead object for spectacular contemplation” \(184\).

Debord’s reference to Eugenio d’Ors, who ‘chose “life instead of eternity.”’ perhaps reflects a sentiment that art should be “arbitrary,” or subjectivist, breaking with traditional norms. But Debord does not suggest a new unity but rather points to an actual dissolution of art. Spectacular culture as it is presented through its “modernistic pseudoinnovations” seeks to “use culture to bury all historical memory”.

Debords opposition to the structuralist project, the “writing degree zero” of figures such as Roland Barthes appears to be from a post Marxist dialectical position. Barthes critique of socialist realism only serves to further separate criticism from the subject \(204\).

In 206 Debord seems to present détournement in the dialectic tradition \(citing Marx as achieving “the most effective use of this insurrectional style”\). In 208 the superlative presentation of détournement is stated. Détournement as “the opposite of quotation” is a reminder of our “cut and paste” subversion. An echo of ‘by any means necessary’. A recognition of the existing negation of culture.
