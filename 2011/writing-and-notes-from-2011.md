# Writing & Notes from 2011

## October 2011

### Egalitarianism of the Enlightenment  : Enlightenment.

I think the Egalitarianism of the enlightenment's public sphere was limited to those with the resources to access it. Within this sphere free thought was encouraged and opinions could be debated. Those outside it, the majority of people,those who were not 'men of letters', "the blind and noisy multitude", the particular, the local and those who could not reason were excluded. The cohesion of this public sphere began to loosen with increasing literacy, the beginnings of romanticism and the emerging nationalism of figures like Herder.

I agree that groups and clubs can act as springboards for new ideas. However when such groups make claims to universality,authority, representation or education then the context in which their ideas are forged becomes more relevant. This continues today for example with Universities which have internal "public spheres" accessible only to academics and students.

### Approach to Stendhal TMA  : Stendhal.

I like to treat each TMA a bit like a work of detection. The equivalent of 'establishing the motive' is clarifying the question. The first part of the question does not require examples of genius \(exclusively\). It requires an analysis of \index{Stendhal}Stendhal's presentation of Napoleon \(as it is\) and how each paragraph contributes \(or not\) to an overall picture.

Each paragraph presents opportunities for establishing Stendhal's motives \(to use the Detective metaphor\). I suggest 'follow the leads' ! For example, why does he choose Melzi and Merveldt for testimonials, why does he choose the particular time and place for a positive view of Napoleon ? Then ... what do the sources actually do or say outside of Stendhal's presentation ? Is he being selective ?

The second part concerns Stendhal's view of \index{Napoleon}Napoleon as a Genius per se. We are directed to the extract for evidence of this. But also we are given an opportunity to present our 'understanding of Stendhal's book'. Such understanding, in my view, can draw on the wider context of the book within Stendhal's life. How did Stendhal form his ideas ? Did they change over time ? How do they contrast with his contemporaries ?

His Napoleon book is after all, a draft. What did he actually publish on Napoleon in his lifetime \(look it up\). His two most famous novels both use Napoleon as a background. Some suggestions. What did he write about himself ? Why did he use a particular style of writing ? What was his education ?

This of course is just background, 'gathering evidence for the prosecution' \(as it were\). To answer the second part of the question is make a personal judgement on the evidence \(of Napoleon as Genius\). I have found this process very rewarding and interesting. Particularly how Stendhal stands in contrast with his peers. He is more real and human than many other Romantics. But that is just my personal judgement.

### Stendhal on style  : Stendhal.

As a youngster in the 1790s, Stendhal resented his bourgeois fathers pretensions of aristocracy. When they praised the arts, "their praises give me a mortal distaste for the most beautiful things". He felt their praise was "in bad faith". "... verse annoyed me because it dragged the sentences out and made them lose their clarity. I loathed steed instead of horse. I called that hypocrisy". Any thoughts ?

### Stendhal on the English  : Stendhal.

" _... those English are gloomy, commonsensical people; I don't know of any people more talkative and yet more frigid_." Letter to Pauline \(His sister\), July 1804

Of England ..."_...a country administered for the sole benefit and glory of between a thousand and twelve hundred families_." From 'Lord Byron in Italy', 1830

I wonder how far national identity determines a view of Napoleon and is it impossible to write anything objective about him ?

### FT Article : Guilt and Glory, the legacy of Empire 

In the wake of recent political debates about the legacy of the British Empire and how it should be taught in schools, there has been much written in the press about 3 recent books by Jeremy Paxman, Richard Gott and Kwasi Kwarteng on the subject.This FT article does a good job of comparing the books.Not directly relevant to TMA03, but I found it interesting food for thought.

### Physiognomy and Napoleon 

Stendhal refers frequently in; his autobiography to Physiognomy, both literally, as in 'reading faces' and metaphorically as the "physiognomy of events". It seems to be a commonplace of the early 19th century and even a light-hearted pastime.

Napoleon said of Physiognomy : "_we must not judge of a man by his face; we can know him only by his conduct. What countenances have I had to judge in the course of my life! What odd examples of physiognomy have come under my observation!_"

### My perfect good faith - Stendhal 

"I don't believe myself to have any other genius, any other guarantee of my worth, beyond ..

1. to depict a likeness of the nature which at certain moments

   appears

   to me with such clarity;

2. I am confident of my perfect good faith, of my reverence for

   what is

   true;

3. and of the pleasure I take in writing, a pleasure which became a

   mania in 1817 \(in Milan, at M.Peronti's, Corsia del Giardino\)

   Note : 13 pages in an hour and a half. Damnably cold, 3 January

   1836."

### Stendhal, The Life of Henry Brulard, NY Review Books, 1995,p.264, Chapter 24

I thought this gives quite a charming insight into Stendhal's motives. He would forget himself writing and find himself literally in the dark scrambling for candles. Anyway what a relief to finish an essay, Damnably windy !

### BBC Documentary : The Last Explorers : Livingstone 

I found this documentary \(link\) a gentle transition to some of the concerns of TMA03. Livingstone was a Doctor, Scottish and Non-conformist like Mungo Park. Unlike Park he wanted to end slavery through commerce and religious conversion. However his mapping of the interior had the unintended consequence of providing information for more ruthless exploitation later. This documentary is available on BBC iplayer until 22nd December 2011.

### William Cobbett on Wilberforce 

**William Cobbett** raging against **William Wilberforce** in his **Political Register** of July 19th 1823.

"_Wilberforce writes long humbug pamphlets ... about West Indian Slavery._"

"_... special care does he take never to write pamphlets about the wretched people in Ireland_,"

_"When he talks about humanity, it is in favour of somebody at a great distance; somebody that the Government has no interest in oppressing._"

"_For about thirty years Wilberforce has been at work about the blacks. Negro slavery has been rendered threefold more harsh in consequence of his efforts._"

_"The whole of the colonies of America, ...must be completely revolutionised, before his schemes are put into practice. Ages will not see the thing done._"

**Cobbett's Political Register, Volume 47, 1823, p.146**

### Article comparing Cobbett and Wilberforce On Peterloo August 30th, 1823

"But Wilberforce listen to me a bit; did you not hear of a parcel of people, who were assembled at Manchester on 16th August 1819 ? These people whom you call free British labourers.Well then these labourers had not run away from any masters. They committed no crimes or misdemeanours towards any masters. About 500 of them were, nevertheless,killed or wounded: they suffered "in life or member"."

"...Did you not object to any parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of those who caused the killing and wounding ? Well then, this was all right, was it ? The killing and wounding at Manchester was right: the thanking of the killers and wounders was right: it was right to applaud the conduct of the Ministers, and to object to the inquiry." Cobbetts Poltical Register, Volume 47, p.518

Source as above

The context of both tirades is a Bill proposed by Wilberforce to fine slave-owners for mistreatment of their slaves. Cobbett is angered at what he percieves as double standards, he also sees a pattern of moral hypocrisy in Protestantism in general.
