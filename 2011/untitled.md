### Egalitarianism of the Enlightenment  : Enlightenment.

I think the Egalitarianism of the enlightenment's public sphere was limited to those with the resources to access it. Within this sphere free thought was encouraged and opinions could be debated. Those outside it, the majority of people,those who were not 'men of letters', "the blind and noisy multitude", the particular, the local and those who could not reason were excluded. The cohesion of this public sphere began to loosen with increasing literacy, the beginnings of romanticism and the emerging nationalism of figures like Herder.

I agree that groups and clubs can act as springboards for new ideas. However when such groups make claims to universality,authority, representation or education then the context in which their ideas are forged becomes more relevant. This continues today for example with Universities which have internal "public spheres" accessible only to academics and students.

### Approach to Stendhal TMA  : Stendhal.

I like to treat each TMA a bit like a work of detection. The equivalent of 'establishing the motive' is clarifying the question. The first part of the question does not require examples of genius \(exclusively\). It requires an analysis of \index{Stendhal}Stendhal's presentation of Napoleon \(as it is\) and how each paragraph contributes \(or not\) to an overall picture.

Each paragraph presents opportunities for establishing Stendhal's motives \(to use the Detective metaphor\). I suggest 'follow the leads' ! For example, why does he choose Melzi and Merveldt for testimonials, why does he choose the particular time and place for a positive view of Napoleon ? Then ... what do the sources actually do or say outside of Stendhal's presentation ? Is he being selective ?

The second part concerns Stendhal's view of \index{Napoleon}Napoleon as a Genius per se. We are directed to the extract for evidence of this. But also we are given an opportunity to present our 'understanding of Stendhal's book'. Such understanding, in my view, can draw on the wider context of the book within Stendhal's life. How did Stendhal form his ideas ? Did they change over time ? How do they contrast with his contemporaries ?

His Napoleon book is after all, a draft. What did he actually publish on Napoleon in his lifetime \(look it up\). His two most famous novels both use Napoleon as a background. Some suggestions. What did he write about himself ? Why did he use a particular style of writing ? What was his education ?

This of course is just background, 'gathering evidence for the prosecution' \(as it were\). To answer the second part of the question is make a personal judgement on the evidence \(of Napoleon as Genius\). I have found this process very rewarding and interesting. Particularly how Stendhal stands in contrast with his peers. He is more real and human than many other Romantics. But that is just my personal judgement.
