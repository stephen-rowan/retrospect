# Writing from 2011

## October 2011

### Egalitarianism of the Enlightenment  : Enlightenment.

I think the Egalitarianism of the enlightenment's public sphere was limited to those with the resources to access it. Within this sphere free thought was encouraged and opinions could be debated. Those outside it, the majority of people,those who were not 'men of letters', "the blind and noisy multitude", the particular, the local and those who could not reason were excluded. The cohesion of this public sphere began to loosen with increasing literacy, the beginnings of romanticism and the emerging nationalism of figures like Herder.

I agree that groups and clubs can act as springboards for new ideas. However when such groups make claims to universality,authority, representation or education then the context in which their ideas are forged becomes more relevant. This continues today for example with Universities which have internal "public spheres" accessible only to academics and students.

### Approach to Stendhal TMA  : Stendhal.

I like to treat each TMA a bit like a work of detection. The equivalent of 'establishing the motive' is clarifying the question. The first part of the question does not require examples of genius \(exclusively\). It requires an analysis of \index{Stendhal}Stendhal's presentation of Napoleon \(as it is\) and how each paragraph contributes \(or not\) to an overall picture.

Each paragraph presents opportunities for establishing Stendhal's motives \(to use the Detective metaphor\). I suggest 'follow the leads' ! For example, why does he choose Melzi and Merveldt for testimonials, why does he choose the particular time and place for a positive view of Napoleon ? Then ... what do the sources actually do or say outside of Stendhal's presentation ? Is he being selective ?

The second part concerns Stendhal's view of \index{Napoleon}Napoleon as a Genius per se. We are directed to the extract for evidence of this. But also we are given an opportunity to present our 'understanding of Stendhal's book'. Such understanding, in my view, can draw on the wider context of the book within Stendhal's life. How did Stendhal form his ideas ? Did they change over time ? How do they contrast with his contemporaries ?

His Napoleon book is after all, a draft. What did he actually publish on Napoleon in his lifetime \(look it up\). His two most famous novels both use Napoleon as a background. Some suggestions. What did he write about himself ? Why did he use a particular style of writing ? What was his education ?

This of course is just background, 'gathering evidence for the prosecution' \(as it were\). To answer the second part of the question is make a personal judgement on the evidence \(of Napoleon as Genius\). I have found this process very rewarding and interesting. Particularly how Stendhal stands in contrast with his peers. He is more real and human than many other Romantics. But that is just my personal judgement.

### Stendhal on style  : Stendhal.

As a youngster in the 1790s, Stendhal resented his bourgeois fathers pretensions of aristocracy. When they praised the arts, "their praises give me a mortal distaste for the most beautiful things". He felt their praise was "in bad faith". "... verse annoyed me because it dragged the sentences out and made them lose their clarity. I loathed steed instead of horse. I called that hypocrisy". Any thoughts ?

### Stendhal on the English  : Stendhal.

" _... those English are gloomy, commonsensical people; I don't know of any people more talkative and yet more frigid_." Letter to Pauline \(His sister\), July 1804

Of England ..."_...a country administered for the sole benefit and glory of between a thousand and twelve hundred families_." From 'Lord Byron in Italy', 1830

I wonder how far national identity determines a view of Napoleon and is it impossible to write anything objective about him ?

### FT Article : Guilt and Glory, the legacy of Empire 

In the wake of recent political debates about the legacy of the British Empire and how it should be taught in schools, there has been much written in the press about 3 recent books by Jeremy Paxman, Richard Gott and Kwasi Kwarteng on the subject.This FT article does a good job of comparing the books.Not directly relevant to TMA03, but I found it interesting food for thought.

### Physiognomy and Napoleon 

Stendhal refers frequently in; his autobiography to Physiognomy, both literally, as in 'reading faces' and metaphorically as the "physiognomy of events". It seems to be a commonplace of the early 19th century and even a light-hearted pastime.

Napoleon said of Physiognomy : "_we must not judge of a man by his face; we can know him only by his conduct. What countenances have I had to judge in the course of my life! What odd examples of physiognomy have come under my observation!_"
